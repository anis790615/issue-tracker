# JavaScript Issue tracker. 
This issue tracker is based on the online video at the link below:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYq9J-Eur9U. 
The issue tracker was re-done completely following ES6, adding alert messages when adding, deleting, or changing the status of an issue.  
The end result can be seen at the link:
